Batch Apex	-Run large jobs that would exceed normal processing limits.	Data cleansing or archiving of records.
Queueable Apex	-Similar to future methods, but provide additional job chaining and allow more complex data types to be used.	Performing sequential processing operations with external Web services.
Scheduled Apex	-Schedule Apex to run at a specified time.	Daily or weekly tasks.
